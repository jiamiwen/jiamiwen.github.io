<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Jiaming Wen (文嘉明)**, a Ph.D. student at [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://whu.edu.cn/), working on cryptography and cyber security. Recently, my passion lies in analyzing and designing various signature schemes and zero-knowledge proof systems based on quantum-resistant assumptions, e.g., Lattice, Multivariate, and Code.

I can be reached via <wenjm@whu.edu.cn> or <cryptowjm@163.com>.

# 🧰 Miscellaneous
## Serendipity
My name starts with "jiami" (Chinese for "encrypt"), and ends with "mingwen" (Chinese for "plaintext"). 

I remove "ng" from it to obtain "miwen" (Chinese for "ciphertext") for several usernames of mine, e.g., [wechat](https://jiamiwen.github.io/images/wechat.jpg), twitter, and github, as I believe it is more suitable for spreading over the public channel :-).
