[//]: # (# ü•∑ About Me üìñ üìù üìß üññ)

I am **Jiaming Wen (ÊñáÂòâÊòé)**, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://whu.edu.cn/), with a concurrent Joint Ph.D. Program at the [University of Wollongong (UOW)](http://uow.edu.au/). I am working on cryptography and cyber security, to be more specific:
- Recently, my passion lies in analyzing and designing various signature schemes and zero-knowledge protocols based on quantum-resistant assumptions, e.g., Lattice, Multivariate, and Code.
- In the long term, I hope using technologies to establish trust among individuals at almost zero cost, which I consider to be the most subtle and great aspect of cryptography.

Feel free to reach me via <cryptowjm@163.com> (preferred) or <wenjm@whu.edu.cn>, if questions or we share common tastes.

# üìú Publications
Roughly, my existing publications can be categorized into Post-quantum (Lattice, Multivariate), and Pre-quantum (DL, Pairing). Most of them are irrigations and not worth reading. I have also been looking forward and trying my best to dominate works that please me. Unfortunately, they have been rejected until now.

# üß∞ Misc
## Serendipity
My name starts with "jiami" (Chinese for "encrypt"), and ends with "mingwen" (Chinese for "plaintext"). 
<br>I remove "ng" from it to obtain "miwen" (Chinese for "ciphertext") for several usernames of mine, e.g., [wechat](https://jiamiwen.github.io/images/wechat.jpg), twitter, and github, as I believe it is more suitable for spreading over the public channel :-)
## Some useful links
- [My bilibili space](https://space.bilibili.com/59630141), including several talks/courses I am or was interested in.
- [IACR ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/), a mysterious website suggested visiting every day.
- [The Lattice Club](https://thelatticeclub.com/), including so many resources about Lattice-based Cryptography.
- [Post-Quantum Signatures Zoo](https://pqshield.github.io/nist-sigs-zoo/), including an overview of Post-Quantum Signatures.
- [Keita Xagawa's Homepage](https://xagawa.net/), including Bibliography on Lattice-based/Code-based Cryptosystems.
- [Kai-Min Chung's Homepage](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~kmchung/), including high-quality cryptography courses in Chinese.
- [Journal of WoCrypt](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/jow.html), a very serious fake journal, whose outcomes include ["ÂÆâÂÖ®ÂΩíÁ∫¶ÂØºËÆ∫"](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/book.html), ["Êï∞Â≠óÁ≠æÂêçÂØÜÂè≤"](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/cryptologic-history.html) and its [slides](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/methodology.html). Here are my always-unfinished [notes for the former](https://jiamiwen.github.io/documents/notes.pdf) and [xmind for the latter](https://jiamiwen.github.io/documents/xmind.pdf), which I hope are salutes to Prof. Guo.
