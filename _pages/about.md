[//]: # (# ü•∑üèÉ About Me üìñ üìù üìß üññ)

I am **Jiaming Wen (ÊñáÂòâÊòé)**, now pursuing my Ph.D. in Cryptography at [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Huanguo Zhang](https://jiamiwen.github.io/documents/Zhang.pdf). 
<br> I am also a CSC Joint Ph.D. student at the [University of Wollongong (UOW)](http://uow.edu.au/), hosted by [Willy ](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/willy-susilo)[Susilo](https://sites.google.com/view/willy-susilo) and studying with the [iC$^2$](https://www.uow.edu.au/engineering-information-sciences/research/institute-cybersecurity-cryptology/). 
<br> Before, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2020.

My research interests are about cryptography and cyber security, to be more specific:
- Recently, my passion lies in analyzing and designing zero-knowledge protocols and signature schemes derived from them, mainly based on linear algebra assumptions that conjectured quantum-resistant (e.g., Lattice, Multivariate, and Code).
- In the long term, I hope using technologies to establish trust among individuals at almost zero cost, which I consider to be the most subtle and elegant aspect of cryptography.

Feel free to reach me via [cryptowjm at 163.com](mailto:cryptowjm@163.com) (preferred) or [wenjm at whu.edu.cn](mailto:wenjm@whu.edu.cn), if questions or we share common tastes.

# üì∞ News
- <font color=Red>2023/12: I moved to AU to begin a new journey. Thanks to whoever assisted me and the China Scholarship Council (CSC).</font>
- 2023/10: My first submission to the [Journal of WoCrypt](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/jow.html) was accepted by the [Editor-in-Chieeeeeeeeeeeeef](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/) after revisions. See the bottom of this page and [the Publisher's website](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/methodology.html).
- 2023/09: Finally, I got this homepage done.

# üìú Publications
Here are research papers that I am the First Author or Corresponding Author. For more, please refer to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IoWa4fYAAAAJ) and [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/324/5245-1.html).

Roughly, my existing publications can be categorized into Post-quantum (Lattice, Multivariate), and Pre-quantum (DL, Pairing). Most of them are irrigation (Based on the evaluation of item 22 in [JoW-001](https://documents.uow.edu.au/~fuchun/jow/001-revisited.pdf)). I am also looking forward to dominate works that please me. Unfortunately, I have not succeeded yet.

# üß∞ Misc
## Serendipity
My name starts with "jiami" (Chinese for "encrypt"), and ends with "mingwen" (Chinese for "plaintext"). 
<br>I remove "ng" from it to obtain "miwen" (Chinese for "ciphertext") for several usernames of mine, e.g., [wechat](https://jiamiwen.github.io/images/wechat.jpg), twitter, and github, as I believe it is more suitable for spreading over the public channel :)
