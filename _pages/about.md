[//]: # (# ü•∑üèÉ About Me üìñ üìù üìß üññ)

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Cryptography at [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://whu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Huanguo Zhang](https://jiamiwen.github.io/documents/Zhang.pdf). 
<br> I am also a CSC Joint Ph.D. student at the [University of Wollongong (UOW)](http://uow.edu.au/), hosted by [Willy ](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/willy-susilo)[Susilo](https://sites.google.com/view/willy-susilo) and studying with the [iC$^2$](https://www.uow.edu.au/engineering-information-sciences/research/institute-cybersecurity-cryptology/). 

Before (Sep 2016 - Jun 2020), I earned my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Wuhan University.

My research interests are about cryptography and cyber security, to be more specific:
- Recently, my passion lies in analyzing and designing zero-knowledge protocols and signature schemes derived from them, mainly based on algebraic assumptions that conjectured quantum-resistant (e.g., Lattice, Multivariate, and Code).
- In the long term, I hope using technologies to establish trust among individuals at almost zero cost, which I consider to be the most subtle and elegant aspect of cryptography.

Feel free to reach me via [wenjm at whu.edu.cn](mailto:wenjm@whu.edu.cn) or [cryptowjm at \left{163,gmail\right}.com](mailto:cryptowjm@163.com), if questions or we share common tastes.

# üìú Publications
Here are publications that I am the main contributor (also, as First Author or Corresponding Author). For more, please refer to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IoWa4fYAAAAJ) and [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/324/5245-1.html). Roughly, they can be categorized into Post-quantum (Lattice, Multivariate) and Pre-quantum (DL).

# üß∞ Misc
## Serendipity
My name starts with "jiami" (Chinese for "encrypt"), and ends with "mingwen" (Chinese for "plaintext"). 
<br>I remove "ng" from it to obtain "miwen" (Chinese for "ciphertext") for several usernames of mine, e.g., [wechat](https://jiamiwen.github.io/images/wechat.jpg), twitter, and github, as I believe it is more suitable for spreading over the public channel :)
